**BlanketCon '22** was an in-minecraft virtual event that ran from June 11th through June 15th, 2022.

This modpack contains the event world, built to host events and packed full of community-made convention booths!

**Key Features**:
- Check out 92 convention "booths" built to show off mods, modpacks, and other modding projects!
- Explore a gently winding lakeside campground with hills, bridges, roads, and ornate towers.
- Traverse the map with snowball guns, hex wands, grappling hooks, rocket launchers, and triple jumps!
- Find up to 100 uniquely textured trading cards scattered around different parts of the map!
- Revisit the world where it all went down - or just check it out for the first time!
- Observe a pink flamingo! (huh?)
